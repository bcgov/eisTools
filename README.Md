## Accessible Data for Natural Resource Stewardship

The Ecosystem Information Section strives to make fish and wildlife data easy to access and use. The eisTools package allows for up-to-date biodiversity data to be easily loaded directly into R, removing the need to understand APIs or download multiple files before running analyses. The package also helps visualize and process biodiversity data with reusable RShiny components and simplified data-wrangling methods.

## Objectives

• Make biodiversity data discoverable, accessible and usable for natural resource management :bear:\n
• Help develop RShiny applications to track biodiversity metrics :mag:\n
• Streamline workflows to make analytical processes more efficient :heavy_check_mark:
